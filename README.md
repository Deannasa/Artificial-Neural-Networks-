# Artiifical-Neural-Network
Artiifical Neural Network project for Data Science Seminar 
In this project, we built a Artiifical neural network whose purpose is to analyze the fashionable clothing item and determine what type it is: coat, shirt, sandal, jacket, etc...
At the end we showed our accuracy in a confusion Matrix
